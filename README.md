# üîç What Makes OSINT ‚ÄúOpen Source‚Äù?

*Open source doesn‚Äôt mean open-source software ‚Äî it means the information is publicly accessible, not obtained through hacking or breaking into systems.*
- Sources include:
  - Websites & blogs
  -	Social media posts
  -	Public records & government databases
  -	News articles & press releases
  -	Satellite images
  -	Online forums & communities
  -	Domain & IP registries
  -	Even cached or archived web pages

## üõ† The OSINT Process
	
  1.	Planning & Direction
     - Define the goal: e.g., find an individual‚Äôs contact info, map a company‚Äôs online infrastructure, geolocate an image.
	2.	Collection
     - Gather relevant data from multiple public sources (manual searches, APIs, specialized tools).
	3.	Processing
     - Clean, filter, and organize raw data (e.g., removing duplicates, extracting metadata).
	4.	Analysis
     - Connect the dots ‚Äî identify relationships, timelines, trends, or suspicious activity.
	5.	Reporting
     - Present findings in a structured way for decision-making or further action.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Ethical Side
	
 - Legal: OSINT uses publicly available info ‚Äî but you must follow laws like GDPR, CCPA, DPDP Act (India), etc.
 - Ethical: You should avoid causing harm ‚Äî especially when working with sensitive personal information.
 - In Ethical Hacking, OSINT is often the first phase (Reconnaissance) before penetration testing.

## üìå Example Use Cases
	
  - Cybersecurity: Identifying exposed company assets before attackers do.
	- Law Enforcement: Tracking missing persons or suspects.
	-	Journalism: Verifying facts and sources.
	-	Business Intelligence: Analyzing competitors.
	-	Threat Intelligence: Detecting early signs of attacks or scams.
	-	Geolocation Investigations: Pinpointing where a photo or video was taken.
